This project explores **customer churn behavior** for a telecom company using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The goal is to uncover patterns and factors that influence why customers leave the service, and to generate actionable business recommendations.

- Identify key churn drivers
- Segment customers by churn risk
- Provide strategic recommendations to reduce churn

- **Senior citizens** and **month-to-month contract users** are more likely to churn.
- **Electronic check** users show much higher churn than other payment methods.
